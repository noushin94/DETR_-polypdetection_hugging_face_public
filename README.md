# Polyp Detection with DETR

This repository hosts a cutting-edge polyp detection system using the DETR (Detection Transformer) model, developed to identify polyps from medical images efficiently. This project leverages datasets sourced from Roboflow and models from Hugging Face, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for medical imaging tasks.

## Project Overview

Our polyp detection system employs the DETR model, a transformer-based architecture known for its effectiveness in object detection tasks. By utilizing datasets from Roboflow and pretrained models from Hugging Face, this system is designed to integrate seamlessly into medical diagnostic workflows, offering high accuracy and reliability.

### Features

- High accuracy polyp detection using the DETR model.
- Integration with Hugging Face for advanced model management.
- Use of Roboflow datasets to enhance training and validation processes.
